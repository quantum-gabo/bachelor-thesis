Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, with more than 20 billion tons produced, every year. Yet, understanding the atomic and mechanical properties of the main component of the concrete, calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) cement hydrates—the complex binder phase of concrete—still poses a challenge.

In this project, we aim to investigate the atomic and mechanical properties of cement hydrates leveraging density-functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) tools. We will first start by using DFT to study the electronic structure, bonding, and mechanical responses of C-S-H at the atomic level. Afterwards, we will use ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) with ML to create a force field on the fly of C-S-H, which will allow us to accurately simulate and capture the complex atomic interactions of cement hydrates while reducing the computation time. By integrating both DFT, AIMD and ML, we seek to provide deeper insights into the fundamental properties of C-S-H and to develop a predictive model that could inform the design of more sustainable and durable concrete materials.
