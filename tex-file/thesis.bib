  abstract = {Despite its ubiquitous presence in the built environment, concrete's molecular-level properties are only recently being explored using experimental and simulation studies. Increasing societal concerns about concrete's environmental footprint have provided strong motivation to develop new concrete with greater specific stiffness or strength (for structures with less material). Herein, a combinatorial approach is described to optimize properties of cement hydrates. The method entails screening a computationally generated database of atomic structures of calcium-silicate-hydrate, the binding phase of concrete, against a set of three defect attributes: calcium-to-silicon ratio as compositional index and two correlation distances describing medium-range silicon-oxygen and calcium-oxygen environments. Although structural and mechanical properties correlate well with calcium-to-silicon ratio, the cross-correlation between all three defect attributes reveals an indentation modulus-to-hardness ratio extremum, analogous to identifying optimum network connectivity in glass rheology. We also comment on implications of the present findings for a novel route to optimize the nanoscale mechanical properties of cement hydrate.},

  abstract = {Despite the ever-increasing interest in multiscale porous materials, the chemophysical origin of their thermal properties at the nanoscale and its connection to the macroscale properties still remain rather obscure. In this paper, we link the atomic- and macroscopic-level thermal properties by combining tools of statistical physics and mean-field homogenization theory. We begin with analyzing the vibrational density of states of several calcium-silicate materials in the cement paste. Unlike crystalline phases, we indicate that calcium silicate hydrates (CSH) exhibit extra vibrational states at low frequencies ({$<$}2 THz) compared to the vibrational states predicted by the Debye model. This anomaly is commonly referred to as the boson peak in glass physics. In addition, the specific-heat capacity of CSH in both dry and saturated states scales linearly with the calcium-to-silicon ratio. We show that the nanoscale-confining environment of CSH decreases the apparent heat capacity of water by a factor of 4. Furthermore, full thermal conductivity tensors for all phases are calculated via the Green-Kubo formalism. We estimate the mean free path of phonons in calcium silicates to be on the order of interatomic bonds. This satisfies the scale separability condition and justifies the use of mean-field homogenization theories for upscaling purposes. Upscaling schemes yield a good estimate of the macroscopic specific-heat capacity and thermal conductivity of cement paste during the hydration process, independent of fitting parameters.},

  abstract = {Hydrated cement is one of the complex composite systems due to the presence of multi-scale phases with varying morphologies. Calcium silicate hydrate, which is the principal binder phase in the hydrated cement, is responsible for the stiffness, strength, and durability of Portland cement concrete. To understand the mechanical and durability behavior of concrete, it is important to investigate the interactions of hydrated cement phases with other materials at the nanoscale. In this regard, the molecular simulation of cement-based materials is an effective approach to study the properties and interactions of the cement system at the fundamental scale. Recently, many studies have been published regarding atomistic simulations to investigate the cement phases to define/explain the microscopic physical and chemical properties, thereby improving the macroscopic performance of hardened binders. The research in molecular simulation of cementitious systems involves researchers with multidisciplinary backgrounds, mainly in two areas: \ding{172} cement chemistry, where the hydration reactions govern most of the chemical and physical properties at the atomic scale; and \ding{173} computational materials science and engineering, where the bottom-up approach is required. The latter approach is still in its infancy, and as such, a study of the prevailing knowledge is useful, namely through an exhaustive literature review. This state-of-the-art report provides a comprehensive survey on studies that were conducted in this area and cites the important findings.},

Indeed, in contrast to the former crystalline model, recent molecular models suggest that the nanoscale structure of C-S-H is amorphous. To elucidate this issue, we analyzed the structure of a realistic simulated model of C-S-H, and compared the latter to crystalline tobermorite, a natural analogue of C-S-H, and to an artificial ideal glass. The results clearly indicate that C-S-H appears as amorphous, when averaged on all atoms. However, an analysis of the order around each atomic species reveals that its structure shows an intermediate degree of order, retaining some characteristics of the crystal while acquiring an overall glass-like disorder. Thanks to a detailed quantification of order and disorder, we show that, while C-S-H retains some signatures of a tobermorite-like layered structure, hydrated species are completely amorphous. {\copyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Among their many industrial applications, calcium silicates are heavily used as a building material as they constitute the main ingredient in today's cement clinker. We report here an extensive surface analysis of synthetic calcium silicate phases (tricalcium silicate, C3S, and dicalcium silicate, C2S) using first-principles computational methods. We calculate surface energies ({$\gamma$}) for all lower-index orientations and determine the most stable surfaces as well as the equilibrium Wulff structures. We analyze the variation of {$\gamma$} with surface coordination number and find an interesting and unexpected trend where loss of coordination of ionic Ca and O atoms can lower {$\gamma$}. The stability of surface orientations is examined as a function of oxygen partial pressure. Finally, we compute the energy required to remove Ca from different surfaces and find that it is inversely proportional to {$\gamma$}, supporting the energetic preference of extracting atoms from higher energy surfaces. Knowledge of the atomic structure and properties of calcium silicate surfaces is important for understanding and controlling the hydration of such systems.},

  abstract = {Calcium silicate hydrate, or C--S--H, is the chief hydration product of Portland cement. The structure of the C--S--H phase within cement has been proposed and developed via molecular simulations. In such simulations, empirical interatomic potentials for water molecules within C--S--H are adopted to govern the position and relative motion of this key constituent. Initial simulations and force fields of C--S--H have assumed the simplest molecular model of H2O termed ``single point charge'' or SPC, but this choice has not been validated by comparison with other computational models of water that confer additional bond flexibility or charge distribution. To enable efficiently computational modeling of C--S--H and to explore the role that H2O plays in maintaining C--S--H structure and properties, the choice of an efficient and accurate water model is critical. Here, we consider five distinct, classical atomistic water models (SPC, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P05, and TIP5P) to determine the effects of these computational simplifications on C--S--H properties. Quantitative comparison of all five water models shows that the appropriate water model depends on the C--S--H characteristics of interest. Among these models, both SPC and TIP5P models successfully predict key properties of the structure and elastic constants of C--S--H, as well as the dynamics of water molecules within C--S--H.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an important tool to understand the physical and chemical properties of cement hydrates at the atomic level. MD with the machine learning potential (MLP) is considered a promising approach for accurate prediction of material properties. However, the applications of machine learning MD for multicomponent systems with a liquid--solid interface have been limited so far. In this work, we used artificial neural networks (ANNs) to construct MLPs for tobermorite minerals. Two MLPs were produced by optimization using different objective functions: one MLP was optimized for both the forces and energies of density functional theory (DFT) results (MLP-FE), and the other MLP was fitted to only the energies (MLP-E). Accuracy assessments of the MLPs were performed for lattice parameters, elastic constants, and bulk, shear moduli, and vibrational density of states. The results of the assessments showed that the accuracy of the potentials largely depended on the objective functions used in the training of the ANNs, i.e., MLP-FE was comparable to the potential energy surface (PES) of DFT, although MLP-E failed to reproduce the several physical quantities given by DFT. To evaluate the applicability of MLP-FE to extended systems beyond the limits of DFT calculations, a large scale MD simulation of a nanoporous tobermorite model was demonstrated using MLP-FE. The transport and distribution properties of atoms in the liquid part of the porous model were investigated. Slow diffusion of water confined in a nanopore was detected, and the results were consistent with experimental data and previous works using classical force fields. The results obtained in this study suggested that MD with MLP is a practical method for large scale molecular simulations of cement hydrates with DFT accuracy.},

These structures were subjected to structural relaxation by geometry optimization and molecular dynamics steps. That resulted in a set of energies within each model. Despite an energy distribution between individual structures within each model, significant energy differences are observed between the three models. The C-S-H model related to the lowest energy is considered as the most probable. It turns out to be characterized by the distribution of dimeric and pentameric silicates and the absence of monomers.

  abstract = {Despite decades of studies of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H), the structurally complex binder phase of concrete, the interplay between chemical composition and density remains essentially unexplored. Together these characteristics of C-S-H define and modulate the physical and mechanical properties of this ``liquid stone'' gel phase. With the recent determination of the calcium/silicon (C/S = 1.7) ratio and the density of the C-S-H particle (2.6 g/cm3) by neutron scattering measurements, there is new urgency to the challenge of explaining these essential properties. Here we propose a molecular model of C-S-H based on a bottom-up atomistic simulation approach that considers only the chemical specificity of the system as the overriding constraint. By allowing for short silica chains distributed as monomers, dimers, and pentamers, this C-S-H archetype of a molecular description of interacting CaO, SiO2, and H2O units provides not only realistic values of the C/S ratio and the density computed by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation of water adsorption at 300 K. The model, with a chemical composition of (CaO)1.65(SiO2)(H2O)1.75, also predicts other essential structural features and fundamental physical properties amenable to experimental validation, which suggest that the C-S-H gel structure includes both glass-like short-range order and crystalline features of the mineral tobermorite. Additionally, we probe the mechanical stiffness, strength, and hydrolytic shear response of our molecular model, as compared to experimentally measured properties of C-S-H. The latter results illustrate the prospect of treating cement on equal footing with metals and ceramics in the current application of mechanism-based models and multiscale simulations to study inelastic deformation and cracking.},

  abstract = {The more than 20 billion tons of concrete, produced every year, is responsible for 5--7\% of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Yet, there is no other viable material that can substitute concrete to meet the need for civil infrastructure in the developed and developing countries. This leaves reducing concrete's carbon footprint as the only path forward to meet environmental targets. The strength and durability properties of concrete rely on the calcium-silicate-hydrate (CSH) phase that forms during cement hydration. Controlling the structure and properties of CSH phase is challenging, due to the intrinsic multiscale complexity of this hydration product that spans several orders of magnitude in length scale (from nanometers to microns). The existing lack in scientifically consistent insights into structure and properties of CSH has been the major obstacle to the development of greener formulations of modern concrete. In this chapter, we review how bridging general concepts from condense matter physics to cement and concrete research has revolutionized our contemporary understanding of the CSH phase and its making-up at the nanoscale, redefining this ubiquitous material described simultaneously as a spanning space continuous matrix and as a cohesive granular material that degrades and creeps over time.},

  abstract = {C-(A)-S-H(I) is a calcium silicate hydrate that is studied extensively as a model for the main binding phase in concrete. It is a structurally imperfect form of 14{\AA} tobermorite that has variable composition and length of (alumino)silicate anions. New structural-chemical formulae are presented for single- and double-chain tobermorite-based phases and equations are provided that can be used to calculate a number of useful quantities from 29Si NMR data. It is shown that there are no interlayer calcium ions when the silicate chains are of infinite length and that one is added for each tetrahedral 'bridging' site that is vacant. Preparations that have Ca/Si greater than about 1.4 include an intermixed Ca-rich phase. It is not possible to generate a structural model for a dimer that is crystal-chemically consistent with known calcium silicate hydrates if the starting structure is an orthotobermorite, i.e. of the type that has been used in all previous studies. Crystal-chemically plausible models are developed that are based instead on clinotobermorite. A number of models that represent different mean chain lengths are developed using crystal-chemical and geometrical reasoning. The models account for experimental observations, including variations in Ca/Si, H2O/Si, (alumino)silicate anion structure and layer spacing. {\copyright} 2014.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) present a significant advancement in fitting molecular potential energy surfaces and predicting molecular crystal structures and mechanical properties by closely approximating first-principles (FP) calculations results while substantially reducing computational time. In this work, utilizing datasets derived from FP calculations, neural equivariant interatomic potentials (NequIP) and Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics (DPMD) was implemented to develop MLIPs for tobermorite 9, 11, 14 {\AA}. The accuracy and efficiency of NequIP and DPMD were assessed by predicting energies and forces as well as performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The findings indicate that NequIP closely fits the results of FP calculations, with both accuracy and efficiency improved by 1{$\sim$}2 orders of magnitude compared to the DPMD. This demonstrates that MLIPs developed through NequIP for tobermorites have the capacity to enhance the capability of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.},
