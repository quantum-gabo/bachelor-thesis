  abstract = {Despite its ubiquitous presence in the built environment, concrete's molecular-level properties are only recently being explored using experimental and simulation studies. Increasing societal concerns about concrete's environmental footprint have provided strong motivation to develop new concrete with greater specific stiffness or strength (for structures with less material). Herein, a combinatorial approach is described to optimize properties of cement hydrates. The method entails screening a computationally generated database of atomic structures of calcium-silicate-hydrate, the binding phase of concrete, against a set of three defect attributes: calcium-to-silicon ratio as compositional index and two correlation distances describing medium-range silicon-oxygen and calcium-oxygen environments. Although structural and mechanical properties correlate well with calcium-to-silicon ratio, the cross-correlation between all three defect attributes reveals an indentation modulus-to-hardness ratio extremum, analogous to identifying optimum network connectivity in glass rheology. We also comment on implications of the present findings for a novel route to optimize the nanoscale mechanical properties of cement hydrate.},

  abstract = {Despite the ever-increasing interest in multiscale porous materials, the chemophysical origin of their thermal properties at the nanoscale and its connection to the macroscale properties still remain rather obscure. In this paper, we link the atomic- and macroscopic-level thermal properties by combining tools of statistical physics and mean-field homogenization theory. We begin with analyzing the vibrational density of states of several calcium-silicate materials in the cement paste. Unlike crystalline phases, we indicate that calcium silicate hydrates (CSH) exhibit extra vibrational states at low frequencies ({$<$}2 THz) compared to the vibrational states predicted by the Debye model. This anomaly is commonly referred to as the boson peak in glass physics. In addition, the specific-heat capacity of CSH in both dry and saturated states scales linearly with the calcium-to-silicon ratio. We show that the nanoscale-confining environment of CSH decreases the apparent heat capacity of water by a factor of 4. Furthermore, full thermal conductivity tensors for all phases are calculated via the Green-Kubo formalism. We estimate the mean free path of phonons in calcium silicates to be on the order of interatomic bonds. This satisfies the scale separability condition and justifies the use of mean-field homogenization theories for upscaling purposes. Upscaling schemes yield a good estimate of the macroscopic specific-heat capacity and thermal conductivity of cement paste during the hydration process, independent of fitting parameters.},

  abstract = {Hydrated cement is one of the complex composite systems due to the presence of multi-scale phases with varying morphologies. Calcium silicate hydrate, which is the principal binder phase in the hydrated cement, is responsible for the stiffness, strength, and durability of Portland cement concrete. To understand the mechanical and durability behavior of concrete, it is important to investigate the interactions of hydrated cement phases with other materials at the nanoscale. In this regard, the molecular simulation of cement-based materials is an effective approach to study the properties and interactions of the cement system at the fundamental scale. Recently, many studies have been published regarding atomistic simulations to investigate the cement phases to define/explain the microscopic physical and chemical properties, thereby improving the macroscopic performance of hardened binders. The research in molecular simulation of cementitious systems involves researchers with multidisciplinary backgrounds, mainly in two areas: \ding{172} cement chemistry, where the hydration reactions govern most of the chemical and physical properties at the atomic scale; and \ding{173} computational materials science and engineering, where the bottom-up approach is required. The latter approach is still in its infancy, and as such, a study of the prevailing knowledge is useful, namely through an exhaustive literature review. This state-of-the-art report provides a comprehensive survey on studies that were conducted in this area and cites the important findings.},

  abstract = {Despite advances in the characterization and modeling of cement hydrates, the atomic order in Calcium-Silicate-Hydrate (C-S-H), the binding phase of cement, remains an open question. Indeed, in contrast to the former crystalline model, recent molecular models suggest that the nanoscale structure of C-S-H is amorphous. To elucidate this issue, we analyzed the structure of a realistic simulated model of C-S-H, and compared the latter to crystalline tobermorite, a natural analogue of C-S-H, and to an artificial ideal glass. The results clearly indicate that C-S-H appears as amorphous, when averaged on all atoms. However, an analysis of the order around each atomic species reveals that its structure shows an intermediate degree of order, retaining some characteristics of the crystal while acquiring an overall glass-like disorder. Thanks to a detailed quantification of order and disorder, we show that, while C-S-H retains some signatures of a tobermorite-like layered structure, hydrated species are completely amorphous. {\copyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

  abstract = {Since its widespread use in concrete began over 100 years ago, the chemical composition and physical properties of portland cement have changed only incrementally in response to various and competing pressures of constructability and cost. Instead, the construction demands have been met largely through the development and introduction of chemical admixtures that are added to the binder during mixing. These same demands persist into the 21st Century and are just as important now as before, yet newer driving forces are simultaneously pushing the industry both toward more automated construction and toward more sustainable concrete materials that generate lower CO2 and have longer service life. These new cement binder formulations and new construction technologies are expected to go well outside the bounds of traditional portland cement compositions and batching and placing practices. This study examines the origins of these new market demands and the influence they are having on the construction industry. Seven scientific or technological pathways are identified that will be critical for enabling the kinds of transformational changes in cement and concrete construction that the industry needs: (i) additive manufacturing, (ii) designer admixtures, (iii) curated materials data repositories, (iv) computationally designed composites, (v) big data and smart materials, (vi) alternative binder compositions, and (vii) next-generation instrumentation.},

Like the LAPW method it can be used to treat first-row and transition-metal elements with affordable effort and provides access to the full wave function. The augmentation procedure is generalized in that partial-wave expansions are not determined by the value and the derivative of the envelope function at some muffin-tin radius, but rather by the overlap with localized projector functions. The pseudopotential approach based on generalized separable pseudopotentials can be regained by a simple approximation.},

We report here an extensive surface analysis of synthetic calcium silicate phases (tricalcium silicate, C3S, and dicalcium silicate, C2S) using first-principles computational methods. We calculate surface energies ({$\gamma$}) for all lower-index orientations and determine the most stable surfaces as well as the equilibrium Wulff structures. We analyze the variation of {$\gamma$} with surface coordination number and find an interesting and unexpected trend where loss of coordination of ionic Ca and O atoms can lower {$\gamma$}. The stability of surface orientations is examined as a function of oxygen partial pressure. Finally, we compute the energy required to remove Ca from different surfaces and find that it is inversely proportional to {$\gamma$}, supporting the energetic preference of extracting atoms from higher energy surfaces. Knowledge of the atomic structure and properties of calcium silicate surfaces is important for understanding and controlling the hydration of such systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract During the past decade, computer simulations based on a quantum-mechanical description of the interactions between electrons and between electrons and atomic nuclei have developed an increasingly important impact on solid-state physics and chemistry and on materials science---promoting not only a deeper understanding, but also the possibility to contribute significantly to materials design for future technologies. This development is based on two important columns: (i) The improved description of electronic many-body effects within density-functional theory (DFT) and the upcoming post-DFT methods. (ii) The implementation of the new functionals and many-body techniques within highly efficient, stable, and versatile computer codes, which allow to exploit the potential of modern computer architectures. In this review, I discuss the implementation of various DFT functionals [local-density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, hybrid functional mixing DFT, and exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange] and post-DFT approaches [DFT + U for strong electronic correlations in narrow bands, many-body perturbation theory (GW) for quasiparticle spectra, dynamical correlation effects via the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem (AC-FDT)] in the Vienna ab initio simulation package VASP. VASP is a plane-wave all-electron code using the projector-augmented wave method to describe the electron-core interaction. The code uses fast iterative techniques for the diagonalization of the DFT Hamiltonian and allows to perform total-energy calculations and structural optimizations for systems with thousands of atoms and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for ensembles with a few hundred atoms extending over several tens of ps. Applications in many different areas (structure and phase stability, mechanical and dynamical properties, liquids, glasses and quasicrystals, magnetism and magnetic nanostructures, semiconductors and insulators, surfaces, interfaces and thin films, chemical reactions, and catalysis) are reviewed. {\copyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Strength and other mechanical properties of cement and concrete rely upon the formation of calcium--silicate--hydrates (C--S--H) during cement hydration. Controlling structure and properties of the C--S--H phase is a challenge, due to the complexity of this hydration product and of the mechanisms that drive its precipitation from the ionic solution upon dissolution of cement grains in water. Departing from traditional models mostly focused on length scales above the micrometer, recent research addressed the molecular structure of C--S--H. However, small-angle neutron scattering, electron-microscopy imaging, and nanoindentation experiments suggest that its mesoscale organization, extending over hundreds of nanometers, may be more important. Here we unveil the C--S--H mesoscale texture, a crucial step to connect the fundamental scales to the macroscale of engineering properties. We use simulations that combine information of the nanoscale building units of C--S--H and their effective interactions, obtained from atomistic simulations and experiments, into a statistical physics framework for aggregating nanoparticles. We compute small-angle scattering intensities, pore size distributions, specific surface area, local densities, indentation modulus, and hardness of the material, providing quantitative understanding of different experimental investigations. Our results provide insight into how the heterogeneities developed during the early stages of hydration persist in the structure of C--S--H and impact the mechanical performance of the hardened cement paste. Unraveling such links in cement hydrates can be groundbreaking and controlling them can be the key to smarter mix designs of cementitious materials.},

  abstract = {Calcium silicate hydrate, or C--S--H, is the chief hydration product of Portland cement. The structure of the C--S--H phase within cement has been proposed and developed via molecular simulations. In such simulations, empirical interatomic potentials for water molecules within C--S--H are adopted to govern the position and relative motion of this key constituent. Initial simulations and force fields of C--S--H have assumed the simplest molecular model of H2O termed ``single point charge'' or SPC, but this choice has not been validated by comparison with other computational models of water that confer additional bond flexibility or charge distribution. To enable efficiently computational modeling of C--S--H and to explore the role that H2O plays in maintaining C--S--H structure and properties, the choice of an efficient and accurate water model is critical. Here, we consider five distinct, classical atomistic water models (SPC, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P05, and TIP5P) to determine the effects of these computational simplifications on C--S--H properties. Quantitative comparison of all five water models shows that the appropriate water model depends on the C--S--H characteristics of interest. Among these models, both SPC and TIP5P models successfully predict key properties of the structure and elastic constants of C--S--H, as well as the dynamics of water molecules within C--S--H.},

This method realizes automatic generation of machine learning force fields on the basis of Bayesian inference during molecular dynamics simulations, where the first-principles calculations are only executed, when new configurations out of already sampled datasets appear. The developed method is applied to the calculation of melting points of Al, Si, Ge, Sn and MgO. The applications indicate that more than 99\% of the first-principles calculations are bypassed during the force field generation. This allows the machine to quickly construct first-principles datasets over wide phase spaces. Furthermore, with the help of the generated machine learning force fields, simulations are accelerated by a factor of thousand compared with first-principles calculations. Accuracies of the melting points calculated by the force fields are examined by thermodynamic perturbation theory, and the examination indicates that the machine learning force fields can quantitatively reproduce the first-principles melting points.},

The key to deriving second-, third- and fourth-order Birch--Murnaghan equations-of-state (EOSs) is not requiring a differential to describe the dimensions of a body owing to isotropic, uniform, and finite change in length and, therefore, volume. Truncation of higher orders of finite strain to express the Helmholtz free energy is not equal to ignoring higher-order pressure derivatives of the bulk modulus as zero. To better understand the Eulerian scheme, finite strain is defined by taking the pre-compressed state as the reference and EOSs are derived in both the Lagrangian and Eulerian schemes. In the Lagrangian scheme, pressure increases less significantly upon compression than the Eulerian scheme. Different Eulerian strains are defined by expansion of linear and cubed length and the first- and third-power Eulerian EOSs are derived in these schemes. Fitting analysis of pressure-scale-free data using these equations indicates that the Lagrangian scheme is inappropriate to describe P-V-T relations of MgO, whereas three Eulerian EOSs including the Birch--Murnaghan EOS have equivalent significance.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an important tool to understand the physical and chemical properties of cement hydrates at the atomic level. MD with the machine learning potential (MLP) is considered a promising approach for accurate prediction of material properties. However, the applications of machine learning MD for multicomponent systems with a liquid--solid interface have been limited so far. In this work, we used artificial neural networks (ANNs) to construct MLPs for tobermorite minerals. Two MLPs were produced by optimization using different objective functions: one MLP was optimized for both the forces and energies of density functional theory (DFT) results (MLP-FE), and the other MLP was fitted to only the energies (MLP-E). Accuracy assessments of the MLPs were performed for lattice parameters, elastic constants, and bulk, shear moduli, and vibrational density of states. The results of the assessments showed that the accuracy of the potentials largely depended on the objective functions used in the training of the ANNs, i.e., MLP-FE was comparable to the potential energy surface (PES) of DFT, although MLP-E failed to reproduce the several physical quantities given by DFT. To evaluate the applicability of MLP-FE to extended systems beyond the limits of DFT calculations, a large scale MD simulation of a nanoporous tobermorite model was demonstrated using MLP-FE. The transport and distribution properties of atoms in the liquid part of the porous model were investigated. Slow diffusion of water confined in a nanopore was detected, and the results were consistent with experimental data and previous works using classical force fields. The results obtained in this study suggested that MD with MLP is a practical method for large scale molecular simulations of cement hydrates with DFT accuracy.},

These structures were subjected to structural relaxation by geometry optimization and molecular dynamics steps. That resulted in a set of energies within each model. Despite an energy distribution between individual structures within each model, significant energy differences are observed between the three models.

  abstract = {Understanding the atomistic structure of Calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H), the main product of cement hydration, is of paramount importance to better formulate sustainable cement. The existing atomistic models are not in total agreement with experimental results and fail to explain the nanosized nature of C-S-H. Here, we present a new approach for describing the complexity of these structures at the molecular level, enabling a detailed comparison of C-S-H models. The new methodology encodes a full, large scale atomistic C-S-H structure by a simple, readable string of characters, similar to the way the base sequence in DNA encodes a vast range of different proteins. We then use the methodology to assess 14{\AA} tobermorite-defect structures and their stabilities using DFT and classical molecular dynamics. Finally we highlight how the model may be extended to develop reliable atomistic C-S-H models for a range of Ca/Si ratios and conditions.},

The accuracy of this potential is validated through calculations of energetics, structural, and elastic properties, demonstrating alignment with first principle calculations and an efficiency 2--3 orders of magnitude higher.

By adjusting the model architecture and analyzing the datasets, we demonstrate that the optimized artificial neural network model not only performs well during the learning process but also accurately predicts hydration heat for various cement composites from an extra dataset. This approach offers a more efficient way to measure hydration heat for cement composites, reducing the need for labor- and time-intensive sample preparation and testing. Furthermore, it opens up possibilities for applying similar machine learning approaches to predict other properties of cement composites, contributing to efficient cement research and production.},

They also have a reduced computational cost compared to hybrid functionals, which results from the restriction of Fock exchange calculations to small inter-electron separations. These functionals are defined by an overall fraction of Fock exchange and a length scale for exchange screening. We systematically examine this two-parameter space to assess the performance of hybrid screened exchange (sX) functionals and to determine a balance between improving accuracy and reducing the screening length, which can further reduce computational costs. Three parameter choices emerge as useful: "sX-PBE" is an approximation to the sX-LDA screened exchange density functionals based on the local density approximation (LDA); "HSE12" minimizes the overall error over all tests performed; and "HSE12s" is a range-minimized functional that matches the overall accuracy of the existing HSE06 parameterization but reduces the Fock exchange length scale by half. Analysis of the error trends over parameter space produces useful guidance for future improvement of density functionals.},

The present paper discusses the evolution of models describing the nanostructure of the calcium silicate hydrate (C--S--H) over the past century (descriptive models), with a focus on the models presented in the last fifteen years, 2000--2014 (descriptive and predictive models), marked with the breakthrough of nanotechnology. The purposes and outcomes of the suggested models are discussed, along with their limitations. The article concludes that notwithstanding the enormous potentials nanotechnology and advanced molecular modelling have offered in the field, modern models are, in essence, still expanding on the colloidal or layered models suggested in the 60s, rather than providing a ground breaking new approach. However, it is generally recognised that nanotechnology and molecular modelling have, facilitated the shift from descriptive to predictive models, saving time and resources by extrapolating results of very lengthy experiments, e.g. sorption isotherms, or by mathematically manipulating the C--S--H components to derive different structures and assemblages, that would have been difficult or impossible in practice. In that sense, the new experimental methods available, paired with analytical models are able to provide further justification of the pioneering studies and advance cement nanoscience, paving the way to the production of innovative, nanomodified cements, with minimum Portland cement content.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of studies of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H), the structurally complex binder phase of concrete, the interplay between chemical composition and density remains essentially unexplored. Together these characteristics of C-S-H define and modulate the physical and mechanical properties of this ``liquid stone'' gel phase. With the recent determination of the calcium/silicon (C/S = 1.7) ratio and the density of the C-S-H particle (2.6 g/cm3) by neutron scattering measurements, there is new urgency to the challenge of explaining these essential properties. Here we propose a molecular model of C-S-H based on a bottom-up atomistic simulation approach that considers only the chemical specificity of the system as the overriding constraint. By allowing for short silica chains distributed as monomers, dimers, and pentamers, this C-S-H archetype of a molecular description of interacting CaO, SiO2, and H2O units provides not only realistic values of the C/S ratio and the density computed by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation of water adsorption at 300 K. The model, with a chemical composition of (CaO)1.65(SiO2)(H2O)1.75, also predicts other essential structural features and fundamental physical properties amenable to experimental validation, which suggest that the C-S-H gel structure includes both glass-like short-range order and crystalline features of the mineral tobermorite. Additionally, we probe the mechanical stiffness, strength, and hydrolytic shear response of our molecular model, as compared to experimentally measured properties of C-S-H. The latter results illustrate the prospect of treating cement on equal footing with metals and ceramics in the current application of mechanism-based models and multiscale simulations to study inelastic deformation and cracking.},

We present two related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content of the exchange-correlation hole, while substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction. Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities, (iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior of the potential and density. It appears that SIC can also remedy the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and {$s$} -{$d$} interconfigurational energies of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density, based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder.},

Close agreement with numerical RPA values for {$\varepsilonc$}({$rs$},0), {$\varepsilonc$}({$rs$},1), and the spin stiffness {$\alphac$}({$rs$})={$\partial$}2{$\varepsilonc$}({$rs$}, {$\zeta$}=0)/{$\delta\zeta$}2, and recovery of the correct {$rs$}ln{$rs$} term for {$rs\rightarrow$}0, indicate the appropriateness of the chosen analytic form. Beyond RPA, different parameters for the same analytic form are found by fitting to the Green's-function Monte Carlo data of Ceperley and Alder [Phys. Rev.

  abstract = {The Hellmann-Feynman theorem has, with a few exceptions, not been exploited to the degree that it merits. This is due, at least in part, to a widespread failure to recognize that its greatest value may be conceptual rather than numerical, i.e., in achieving insight into molecular properties and behavior. In this brief overview, we shall discuss three examples of significant concepts that have come out of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem: (1) The forces exerted upon the nuclei in molecules are entirely Coulombic in nature. (2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities. To summarize, energy and force analyses should not be viewed as competitive but rather as complementary.},

  abstract = {Understanding cement hydration is of crucial importance for the application of cementitious materials, including cemented paste backfill. In this work, the adsorption of a single water molecule on an M3-C3S (111) surface is investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The adsorption energies for 14 starting geometries are calculated and the electronic properties of the reaction are analysed. Two adsorption mechanisms, molecular adsorption and dissociative adsorption, are observed and six adsorption configurations are found. The results indicate that spontaneous dissociative adsorption is energetically favored over molecular adsorption. Electrons are transferred from the surface to the water molecule during adsorption. The density of states (DOS) reveals the bonding mechanisms between water and the surface. This study provides an insight into the adsorption mechanism at an atomic level, and can significantly promote the understanding of cement hydration within such systems.},

  abstract = {The more than 20 billion tons of concrete, produced every year, is responsible for 5--7\% of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Yet, there is no other viable material that can substitute concrete to meet the need for civil infrastructure in the developed and developing countries. This leaves reducing concrete's carbon footprint as the only path forward to meet environmental targets. The strength and durability properties of concrete rely on the calcium-silicate-hydrate (CSH) phase that forms during cement hydration. Controlling the structure and properties of CSH phase is challenging, due to the intrinsic multiscale complexity of this hydration product that spans several orders of magnitude in length scale (from nanometers to microns). The existing lack in scientifically consistent insights into structure and properties of CSH has been the major obstacle to the development of greener formulations of modern concrete. In this chapter, we review how bridging general concepts from condense matter physics to cement and concrete research has revolutionized our contemporary understanding of the CSH phase and its making-up at the nanoscale, redefining this ubiquitous material described simultaneously as a spanning space continuous matrix and as a cohesive granular material that degrades and creeps over time.},

  abstract = {C-(A)-S-H(I) is a calcium silicate hydrate that is studied extensively as a model for the main binding phase in concrete. It is a structurally imperfect form of 14{\AA} tobermorite that has variable composition and length of (alumino)silicate anions. New structural-chemical formulae are presented for single- and double-chain tobermorite-based phases and equations are provided that can be used to calculate a number of useful quantities from 29Si NMR data. It is shown that there are no interlayer calcium ions when the silicate chains are of infinite length and that one is added for each tetrahedral 'bridging' site that is vacant. Preparations that have Ca/Si greater than about 1.4 include an intermixed Ca-rich phase. It is not possible to generate a structural model for a dimer that is crystal-chemically consistent with known calcium silicate hydrates if the starting structure is an orthotobermorite, i.e. of the type that has been used in all previous studies. Crystal-chemically plausible models are developed that are based instead on clinotobermorite. A number of models that represent different mean chain lengths are developed using crystal-chemical and geometrical reasoning. The models account for experimental observations, including variations in Ca/Si, H2O/Si, (alumino)silicate anion structure and layer spacing. {\copyright} 2014.},

We propose the first meta-generalized-gradient approximation (meta-GGA) that is fully constrained, obeying all 17 known exact constraints that a meta-GGA can. It is also exact or nearly exact for a set of ``appropriate norms,'' including rare-gas atoms and nonbonded interactions. This strongly constrained and appropriately normed meta-GGA achieves remarkable accuracy for systems where the exact exchange-correlation hole is localized near its electron, and especially for lattice constants and weak interactions.},

Based on an historical approach of the science of concrete and reinforced concrete in particular, this paper calls for the exploration of radical changes in three key aspects of concrete use: reinforcement, binder content, and implementation methods. More precisely, it is suggested that, in parallel to the introduction of robotic fabrication methods, digital technologies may be key for the introduction several innovations like (i) rebar-free reinforcement using non-convex granular media; (ii) compression-optimized concrete structures, using topology optimization, architectural geometry, and 3D-printing or origami-patterned formworks; (iii) truly digital concrete through the coupling of massive data collection and deep learning.},

This thesis first briefly introduces the development history of MD simulation and its application in cement-based materials, and explains the basic concepts and analysis process in MD simulation. After that, the mechanical properties and interface interaction simulation of cement-based materials are described in detail, focusing on the various modeling methods, force field selection and research results, and then grasp the research progress of MD simulation of cement-based materials. Finally, the thesis makes a prospect to analyze the future direction of using MD simulation to study the cement materials and the interaction between the cement matrix with other materials (such as rubber).},

The accuracy and efficiency of NequIP and DPMD were assessed by predicting energies and forces as well as performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The findings indicate that NequIP closely fits the results of FP calculations, with both accuracy and efficiency improved by 1{$\sim$}2 orders of magnitude compared to the DPMD. This demonstrates that MLIPs developed through NequIP for tobermorites have the capacity to enhance the capability of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.},
