## Background 
 Concrete is the synthetic material currently produced in volumes larger than any other material on earth. With an annual consumption of approximately 35 billion tonnes, it is only second to water in terms of global usage (Monteiro, 2017; VanDamme, 2018). As the backbone of modern infrastructure, it provides the foundations for essential structures that support societal development---buildings, bridges, roads, dams and more.  Its widespread adoption arises from a unique combination of strength, versatility, and cost-effectiveness, rendering it indispensable for the construction industry.
