In this file, I will keep track of the blog's changes I plan to introduce regularly.  I will also include to-do lists depending on the feedback and performance of the blog.

>[!To-Do]

- [ ] Define the definitive template for the blog. I have collected and tested some templates I came across a couple of weeks ago. 
- [ ] I've decided to begin with `cellular automata`, so we need to define the dynamics of the simulation. I thing it will be better to code it in `C++` or `C`, since performance is important. 
- [ ] Define the blog's sections, or at least the most important ones. Once we define them, we will be able to make more consistent progress.
